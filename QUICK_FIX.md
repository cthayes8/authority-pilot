# ðŸš¨ QUICK FIX - Database Not Deployed

## The Problem
Your database tables don't exist. The error `relation "public.profiles" does not exist` means the schema hasn't been deployed.

## The Solution (2 minutes)

### 1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
**Click here:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/atuzcghgcsqpaobykzeq/sql/new

### 2. Copy the Schema
The full schema is in: `/Users/colinhayes/ai-guide/supabase/schema.sql`

Or copy from the terminal output above.

### 3. Paste & Run
1. Paste the ENTIRE schema into the SQL editor
2. Click the "Run" button (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
3. You should see "Success" messages

### 4. Verify It Worked
Go to: http://localhost:3000/debug

You should now see:
- âœ… Profile Status: Profile Missing â†’ Click "Create Missing Profile"
- âœ… Database Schema: Tables Exist

### 5. Complete Onboarding
Go to: http://localhost:3000/onboarding

Everything should work now!

## Common Issues

**"permission denied for schema public"**
- Make sure you're using the SQL editor in YOUR Supabase project
- The URL should contain: `atuzcghgcsqpaobykzeq`

**"relation already exists"** 
- Good! The tables are created. Just continue.

**Still seeing errors?**
1. Make sure you copied the ENTIRE schema
2. Try running it in smaller chunks if needed
3. Check Supabase logs for detailed errors

Once the schema is deployed, your AuthorityPilot app will be fully functional! ðŸš€
